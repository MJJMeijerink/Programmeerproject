# Crime in the USA

The purpose of this project is to visualize Crime in the United States of America and compare which states it's most dangerous to live in. Additionally we can compare these variables to some demographics like unemployment, the cook PVI and the amount of guns per household. The data spans over several years in recent history. Therefore the changes are visualized over time to easily identify trends in time for the variables.
